            <h3>
              Do I really get a professional free website with my domain name?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes! The Website Essentials plan is available for customers
              registering a new, available domain name. The Website Essentials
              plan includes a website builder with your domain name
              registration, at no extra charge. The website builder included
              with the Domain Essentials plan allows you to build an ad-free, 5
              page website, with ecommerce tools and more! You even get a domain
              email for a completely professional online presence - the best
              deal on the market.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq_content">
            <h3>Who is eligible to get a free website and email?</h3>
            <p>
              Any customer registering a new, available domain name will get a
              free website and email!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq_content">
            <h3>Do I need a domain name?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, every website on the internet needs its own domain name for
              visitors to be able to find it. A custom domain name can make your
              website look professional online. It builds your brand, makes your
              website more memorable, and helps visitors find you online. With
              Website.com, your registration of a professional domain name comes
              with our award-winning website builder to make a 5 page website,
              plus an email account - for free. When domain names are left to
              expire, it becomes open for anyone to register under their name,
              and can lead to identity theft, impersonation, extortion or even
              malware injection. This is why Website.com offers the domain auto
              renewal feature to help prevent these problems from appearing. Let
              us know if you are unsure about whether your domain name is set
              for auto-renewal.

          </div>
          <div class="faq_content">
            <h3>How do I get custom domain emails?</h3>
            <p>
              Using your custom domain name in your email address
              (info@yourdomainname.com) can build your brand and create a sense
              of trust with customers. Want a free domain email? When you
              register a domain name with the Website Essentials plan, you'll
              get a professional email at your domain name and mailbox to manage
              your emails, for free! Read your emails anywhere, or even set up
              emails to be accessed on your phone. Website.com Elite plans and
              above also include professional domain email as part of your
              subscription.

              How much does a website cost? What does a Website.com
              subscription include?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The cost of running a website can be broken into 3 main
              elements: the domain, hosting, and the way to make the website.
              <br /><br />

              A domain is the unique web address that visitors can type into
              the browser to find your website, e.g. www.website.com. A domain
              name is typically a yearly cost, ranging from around $20/year
              and up. Domains from Website.com range from $5.66/year.
              <br /><br />

              Website hosting allows your website files to be stored and seen
              on the internet. This is typically a monthly ongoing cost,
              usually around $14.99/month and up. With Website.com, web
              hosting is included with our website builder! Your web content
              will be stored on our secure servers located in Vancouver,
              Canada. <br /><br />

              The website platform used to create a website is another factor
              of your website cost. The cost of making a website varies
              depending on whether you choose a DIY approach, or hire a web
              designer or developer. Hiring a web expert can be a significant
              expense that generally requires an initial design cost and an
              ongoing maintenance fee. The website builder is included for
              free with a Website.com domain name registration. <br /><br />

              With a Website.com domain name, everything is included to create
              your website, including a professional custom domain name, web
              hosting to host your content, and a free website builder with
              easy tools to create your site or sell online. When you're ready
              to grow, reach international audiences, or market your online
              presence, choose more advanced plans with the features to take
              your business further. A domain name starts at $5.66/year.
              <br /><br />

              Premium website builder plans range from $4/month (promo price
              for the first year), which is an extremely cost effective way to
              own a professional website.
